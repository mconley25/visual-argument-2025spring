**Preview: 2/17**  

I am at the very beginning of my rhetorical collage and am still playing around with many features on GIMP. On Feb. 17, I worked on creating at least two layers, adding in some text, and using tools like the selection and scale for my preview. 

After experimenting with the GIMP software, I feel as though I may have been a little bit too ambitious with my proposal. I am considering using one main image and then playing around with the other tools and effects such as making certain words glow, adding in some texture (possibly blurring), and focusing on the other design principles rather than focusing on too many images. Doing so will help me stay mindful and not too overwhelmed about my design arrangement.

Moving forward, my plan is to nail down one favorite/ eye-catching image and memorable saying so I can start playing around with design principles and hierarchy to make a detailed and empowering collage! 

**Draft: 2/19**

During workshop time I used the Fuzzy Select tool, fill bucket, and the layer mask tool in GIMP. Using these tools allowed me to remove the blue sky background and lay the image of the young woman latering sunscreen on her arm on top of the new, sand background. 

Then, I added text with the saying "The Risk Isn't Worth the Glow." At first, the white text up against the sand was difficult to read. So, I looked up a tutorial on how to add an outline to text. This was a level up moment for me because this was the first tool I learned how to use myself. I intentionally made the outline color red as a nod to a sunburn and what happens when an individual doesn't protect their skin.

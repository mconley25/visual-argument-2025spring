**Preview: 2/17**  

I am at the very beginning of my rhetorical collage and am still playing around with many features on GIMP. On Feb. 17, I worked on creating at least two layers, adding in some text, and using tools like the selection and scale for my preview. 

After experimenting with the GIMP software, I feel as though I may have been a little bit too ambitious with my proposal. I am considering using one main image and then playing around with the other tools and effects such as making certain words glow, adding in some texture (possibly blurring), and focusing on the other design principles rather than focusing on too many images. Doing so will help me stay mindful and not too overwhelmed about my design arrangement.

Moving forward, my plan is to nail down one favorite/ eye-catching image and memorable saying so I can start playing around with design principles and hierarchy to make a detailed and empowering collage! 

**Draft: 2/19**

During workshop time I used the Fuzzy Select tool, fill bucket, and the layer mask tool in GIMP. Using these tools allowed me to remove the blue sky background and lay the image of the young woman lathering sunscreen on her arm on top of the new, sand background. 

Then, I added text with the saying "The Risk Isn't Worth the Glow." At first, the white text up against the sand was difficult to read. So, I looked up a tutorial on how to add an outline to text. This was a level up moment for me because this was the first tool I learned how to use myself. I intentionally made the outline color red as a nod to a sunburn and what happens when an individual doesn't protect their skin. 

**Draft 2/20:**

Today I added more text. I included "Wear Your Sunscreen" under "The Risk Isn't Worth the Glow." While my audience may be able to infer that I want them to wear sunscreen, I decided to add this text just to make my argument extra clear. I also added a QR code to The Skin Cancer Foundation for more informaiton. This is a good call to action for the viewers of this collage. I feel I am ready to submit my draft for peer review. The biggest thing I am wondering about is if the text feels too simple and or immature for such a serious topic like skin cancer. I intentionally made the collage vibrant and trendy to make it appeal to Gen Z, so I almost didn't want it to be too dull or serious. 

**Applying Feedback for Final 2/26:**

In response to my peers feedback, I have decided to change my call to action text because it was too hard to read against the sand background. To fix this, I added a thicker outline to the text and changed the font from Times New Roman Bold Italics to Sans Serif. I think this font is better because it matches the main text better and it is easier to read. I feel like I am satisfied with my final project and it meets the basline criteria as well as aspirational elements like adding a QR code and playing with tools beyond move and text.

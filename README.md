Welcome to Maddie's Rhetorical Collage! 

I am at the very beginning of my rhetorical collage and am still playing around with many features on GIMP. On Feb. 17, I worked on creating at least two layers, adding in some text, and using tools like the selection and scale for my preview. 

After experimenting with the GIMP software, I feel as though I may have been a little bit too ambitious with my proposal. I am considering using one main image and then playing around with the other tools and effects such as making certain words glow, adding in some texture (possibly blurring), and focusing on the other design principles rather than focusing on too many images. Doing so will help me stay mindful and not too overwhelmed about my design arrangement.

Moving forward, my plan is to nail down one favorite/ eye-catching image and memorable saying so I can start playing around with design principles and hierarchy to make a detailed and empowering collage!

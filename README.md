As someone who has had their fair share of painful sunburns, I have learned my lesson to lather up when it's sunny outside. 

**Did You Know?**

Our skin is the largest organ in the human body! Therefore, it's important that we take proactive measures to protect our skin starting at a very young age. 

The sun is no joke. According to The Skin Cancer Foundation, "Having 5 or more sunburns **doubles** your risk for melanoma" ([Skin Cancer Facts](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts/)). But it doesn't have to be this way! Avoiding a painful sunburn is possible by taking proactive measures like wearing a long sleeve t-shirt and hat when it's sunny outside, lathering on and reapplying sunscreen every few hours, and sitting under the shade.

**The Risk Isn't Worth the Glow**

My goal for this rhetorical collage is to infleunce young adults, particulary Gen Z, to protect their skin from the sun by reminding them the risk of not wearing sunscreen is simply not worth the glow of a golden tan or bright red sunburn. If we aren't careful, exposure to the sun can cause early aging and skin cancer. 

So, the next time you visit the beach, or garden outside, or watch a baseball game on a hot, sunny day remember: 

Wear your sunscreen, becasue **the risk isn't worth the glow.**
